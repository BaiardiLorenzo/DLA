# Deep Learning Applications - Labs

This repository contains the labs for the course "Deep Learning Applications" at the University of Florence.

## Folder structure

- `lab1`: Use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification. 
- `lab2`: Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- `lab3`: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).
- `lab4`: OOD Detection and Adversarial Robustness.
- Every folder contains a `README.md` file with the results and the code of the lab.
- requirements.txt: contains the required libraries to run all the labs.
