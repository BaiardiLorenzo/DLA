# Deep Learning Applications - Labs

This repository contains the labs for the course "Deep Learning Applications" at the University of Florence.

The labs that I have completed for the exam are:

- Lab 1: Convolutional Neural Networks
- Lab 2: Natural Language Processing
- Lab 3: Deep Reinforcement Learning

with some tryouts on Lab 4.

## Folder structure

- `lab1`: Use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification. 
- `lab2`: Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- `lab3`: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).
- `lab4`: OOD Detection and Adversarial Learning.
- `data`: Folder with the datatasets used in the laboratory.
- Every folder contains a `README.md` file with the results and the code of the lab.
- requirements.txt: contains the required libraries to run all the labs.

## Lab 1

The first lab is about the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification. The datasets used are CIFAR-10 and MNIST.

## Lab 2

The second lab is about Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Lab 3

The third lab is about Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).

## Lab 4

The fourth lab is about OOD Detection and Adversarial Learning.
